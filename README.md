## Description

The Pomodoro Technique, created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, is a time management method that breaks work into 25-minute intervals (‚Äúpomodori‚Äù) separated by short breaks. After four pomodori, a longer 20‚Äì30 minute break is taken.
The goal is to improve focus and reduce interruptions‚Äîeach pomodoro is indivisible; if interrupted, it‚Äôs either postponed or restarted.

The six steps are:

1. üß† Choose a task  
2. ‚è∞ Set a 25-minute timer  
3. üí™ Work until the timer rings  
4. ‚òï Take a 5‚Äì10 minute break  
5. üîÅ Repeat for four pomodori  
6. üí§ Take a longer 20‚Äì30 minute break  
7. ‚úçÔ∏è Review or refine work; reflect on your progress
